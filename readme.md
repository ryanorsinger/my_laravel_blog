## My Laravel MVC Blog

This is my blog written in PHP, JS, jQuery, and CSS on the Laravel framework.

## Getting Started
- Clone this repository
- Create a database for this application
- Create a `.env.local.php` file inside of `blog.dev/`
- Add the contents of `env-template.php` to `.env.local.php`
- Add your database logins to the values
- Run `composer install`

## Configuration
Your `.env.local.php` file should have the following keys defined, with your own values:
    'DB_HOST' => '',
    'DB_NAME' => '',
    'DB_USER' => '',
    'DB_PASS' => '',
    'USER_PASS' => ''

The project is built using a Model-View-Controller architecture.
